# Neighborhood-Watch-App-
An app where users in a community can report security incidents, such as theft or suspicious activity, in real-time. The app can have a community feed that alerts neighbors to stay vigilant.


# 1. Project Overview
You will build a web-based version of the Neighborhood Watch App that allows users to report incidents in their area, view reports from others, and receive updates on new reports.

# 2. Tools & Technologies
Since you’re already familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, and Node.js, these will be the primary tools:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for interactivity)
Backend: Node.js and Express.js (to handle server-side logic)
Database: MySQL (to store user accounts and incident reports)
Optional: jQuery (for easier JavaScript DOM manipulation) or vanilla JavaScript

# 3. Key Pages/Features to Implement
Below are the essential pages and features for your project using the skills you already have.

1. User Authentication (Login/Signup Page)
Purpose: Users will register and log in to the app to report incidents.
Features:
Sign Up: Form to create an account (username, email, password).
Login: Form to log in to the app.
Tools:
Frontend: HTML form with CSS for styling.
Backend: Node.js and MySQL to handle user accounts.
Password Security: Use the bcrypt library in Node.js to hash and secure passwords.
2. Incident Reporting Page
Purpose: Users can report security issues.
Features:
Form Fields: Incident title, description, location, and incident type (e.g., theft, suspicious activity).
Location: Simple text field for now (later you can add maps if you want to expand).
Save Data: Store the report in a MySQL database.
Tools:
Frontend: HTML form and CSS for layout.
Backend: Node.js and MySQL to handle form submissions and store incident data.
3. Community Feed Page
Purpose: Display a feed of incidents reported in the neighborhood.
Features:
Display a list of incidents with their titles, descriptions, and locations.
Simple sorting or filtering by type of incident (optional).
Tools:
Frontend: HTML to structure the feed, CSS for styling.
Backend: Use Node.js to query the MySQL database and retrieve incident data.
JavaScript: To handle dynamic loading of reports if needed.
5. Incident Details Page
Purpose: Display the details of a specific report.
Features:
Show full details of an incident (title, description, location, and time reported).
Allow users to comment on the incident (optional).
Tools:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to show incident details.
Backend: Use Node.js to fetch incident data from MySQL.
6. Notifications (Optional)
Purpose: Notify users when a new incident is reported (via email or SMS).
Features:
Send an email when a new report is submitted.
Use Node.js with Nodemailer to send notifications.
Tools:
Backend: Node.js with Nodemailer (for email notifications).
MySQL: Store users’ email addresses.

# 4. Development Steps
Step 1: Setup Your Development Environment
Install Node.js and MySQL on your computer.
Set up a basic project directory:

bash
mkdir neighborhood-watch-app
cd neighborhood-watch-app
npm init -y
npm install express mysql2 bcrypt nodemailer
Step 2: Create Basic User Authentication
Create login.html and signup.html for the frontend.
In Node.js, set up routes for /login and /signup using Express.js.
Use bcrypt to hash and store passwords securely in your MySQL database.
Step 3: Create the Incident Reporting Feature
Create a form in report.html where users can submit incidents.
Use Express.js to handle form submissions and store the data in MySQL.
Example code for storing an incident:
javascript
app.post('/report', (req, res) => {
    const { title, description, location, type } = req.body;
    const query = 'INSERT INTO incidents (title, description, location, type) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)';
    db.query(query, [title, description, location, type], (err, result) => {
        if (err) throw err;
        res.redirect('/feed');
    });
});
Step 4: Build the Community Feed
In feed.html, use HTML to create a structure that lists all incidents.
In Node.js, create a route /feed that retrieves incidents from the MySQL database and displays them.
javascript
app.get('/feed', (req, res) => {
    const query = 'SELECT * FROM incidents';
    db.query(query, (err, results) => {
        if (err) throw err;
        res.render('feed', { incidents: results });
    });
});
Step 5: Create Incident Details Page
When a user clicks on an incident in the feed, they should be taken to a page with the full details.
Set up a route /incident/:id in Node.js that fetches the details of a specific incident from MySQL.
Step 6: Add Notifications (Optional)
Use Nodemailer in Node.js to send email notifications when a new incident is reported:
javascript
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');
// Create a transporter object
let transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    service: 'gmail',
    auth: {
        user: 'your-email@gmail.com',
        pass: 'your-password'
    }
});

// Send notification email
app.post('/report', (req, res) => {
    const { title, description, location, type } = req.body;
    const query = 'INSERT INTO incidents (title, description, location, type) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)';
    db.query(query, [title, description, location, type], (err, result) => {
        if (err) throw err;

        let mailOptions = {
            from: 'your-email@gmail.com',
            to: 'user@example.com',
            subject: 'New Incident Reported',
            text: `A new incident has been reported: ${title} at ${location}`
        };

        transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, (error, info) => {
            if (error) {
                return console.log(error);
            }
            console.log('Email sent: ' + info.response);
        });

        res.redirect('/feed');
    });
});
Step 7: Deploy (Optional)
Deploy the app using a service like Heroku or Vercel.
Ensure your MySQL database is hosted (you can use services like ClearDB for a MySQL database on Heroku).

# 5. Database Schema
Here’s an example of how your MySQL tables might look:

Users Table:
sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    password VARCHAR(255)
);

Incidents Table:
sql
CREATE TABLE incidents (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT,
    location VARCHAR(255),
    type VARCHAR(50),
    date_reported TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

# 6. Suggested Development Timeline
Week 1
Days 1-3: Set up the project, build user authentication, and create the report incident feature.
Days 4-5: Build the community feed to display reported incidents.
Day 6: Set up the incident details page.

Week 2
Day 7: Add email notifications (optional).
Day 8-9: Debug and refine the app’s functionality.
Day 10-12: Polish the UI with CSS, make the app mobile-friendly.
Day 13-14: Final testing and deployment (optional).
